### Hi ðŸŒž I'm Emily 

I'm a full-stack developer living in London. As a former journalist, I've spent a lot of my career learning how to unpick issues and uncover their root causes. Since starting my coding journey in 2022, I've been bringing that analytical mindset to problem solving in the tech space. 

You can see some of the projects I've worked on during my web development bootcamp (ending Febraury 2023) below. My goals for this Spring include getting to grips with Next.js and Python!
